Responsive Portfolio website. 

I added in the following to this website. The whole website was made using Bootstrap and I used no self written css. 

    1. Added in a simple about me page with profile picture, bio, and links to github and linked in pages.
    2. A portfolio page that as a link to all my projects. 
    3. A contact page where individuals can leave a message if they are interseted in chatting. The form doesnt submit because i didnt set up the backend yet, but the front end portion has been set up. 

I used a theme provided by Bootswatch - https://bootswatch.com/
